## What is AVIF

AVIF files are images in the AV1 Image file format. Similarly to JPEG, it uses compression to reduce the file size while maintaining the quality. In contrast to JPEG, AVIF files have a higher quality to compression ratio, so people can compress them much smaller without sacrificing quality. The format was developed by the Alliance for Open Media, whose members include Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Mozilla.

Files are compressed using AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) algorithms and stored in HEIF containers. Royalty-free AV1 compression technology is used in this image format. As a result, there are no licensing fees, which means that compression and decoding are possible without paying royalties.
