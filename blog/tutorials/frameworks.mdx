## Framework List

You may be asking yourself, "**How do I use AVIF images in frameworks?** Since AVIF is relatively new, the implementation must be super complicated and time-consuming!" The answer is simple: **Most Javascript front-end frameworks support AVIF natively** and rely on HTML and CSS implementation. We tested the following frameworks for you:

- facebook/react
- vuejs/vue
- angular/angular
- vercel/next.js
- svelte/svelte
- nuxt/nuxt.js
- gatsbyjs/gatsby
- meteor/meteor
- jashkenas/backbone
- polymer/polymer
- emberjs/ember.js

## Example code

To use AVIF in your code, rely on the HTML implementation.
The following code can be used to display AVIF images across all the listed frameworks.

<Syntax language="html">
  {`<picture>
  <source srcSet="/images/react-avif.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcSet="/images/react-avif.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/images/react-avif.jpg" alt="avif in frameworks" />
 </picture>`}
</Syntax>

<Image src="angular-avif" alt="using avif in angular" />

Note that in many frameworks, you can also import the image and then add it as a source.

<Image src="react-avif" alt="using avif in react" />

## Webpack File Loader

In some cases, especially with older versions of frameworks and when using webpack, you may encounter the problem that no appropiate loader is set up:

<Syntax language="html">{`Module parse failed: Unexpected character ' ' (1:0) You may need an
 appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are
 configured to process this fail. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders`}</Syntax>

In this case, add the detection for AVIF files to the fileloader in your webpack.config.js:

<Syntax language="javascript">
  {`module.exports = {
 module: {
  rules: [{
    test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|webp|avif)$/i,
    use: [{loader: 'file-loader'}]
   }]
 }
}`}
</Syntax>

## Automatic conversion

To this date, no framework plugin reliably converts the image to other sizes and formats, such as AVIF, to match the client's device. Node.JS library Sharp implemented AVIF support, which might be a good choice for you.
Next.JS offers an <Link href="nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization" text="automatic image optimization"/>.
