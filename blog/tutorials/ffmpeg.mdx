## FFMPEG AVIF support

Developers submitted the first bug ticket to add AVIF support into FFMPEG three years ago. The widely used FFmpeg multimedia library has integrated AVIF muxing support for this image format based on AV1 royalty-free video technology.

FFmpeg now supports AVIF muxing, based on the existing MOV/MP4 muxer code. It is possible to use FFmpeg's AVIF muxing support for various purposes, including converting still images from other formats to AVIF and creating animated AVIF images.

Vignesh Venkatasubramanian of Google added the AVIF muxer by re-using the existing mov/mp4 muxer. As a result, still and animated images can now be supported.

Sample usage for still image:

<Syntax language="xml">{`ffmpeg -i image.png -c:v libaom-av1 -still-picture 1 image.avif`}</Syntax>

Sample usage for animated AVIF image:

<Syntax language="xml">{`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 animated.avif`}</Syntax>

## What is FFMPEG?

A suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams, FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project. The core of FFmpeg is the command-line tool itself, which is designed to process video and audio files.

FFmpeg is a free software project that includes libraries and programs for handling and manipulating multimedia data. Transcoding, video and image manipulations (i.e., resizing, denoising, etc. ), packaging, streaming, and playback can all be performed using FFmpeg. There is no doubt that this software is the most popular video and image processing software by a long shot. Many companies in many industries use it.

## AVIF

In the HEIF container format, the AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) supports the compression of images or image sequences with AV1 using a single image file. This format competes with HEIC, which uses the same container format based on ISOBMFF, but VC for compression. Version 1.0.0 of the AVIF specification was released in February 2019.

Netflix 2020 benchmarked AVIF against JPEG and found that it had superior compression efficiency and better detail preservation, fewer blocking artifacts, and less color bleeding around hard edges in composites of natural images, text, and graphics.
