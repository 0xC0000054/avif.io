## Support

Numerous enhancements and new features are included in the May 2022 release of Adobe Illustrator for the desktop (version 26.3). Illustrator now supports AVIF files. The AVIF file format utilizes the AV1 compression algorithm, and AV1 is an open file format designed initially for internet video transmission.

## Adobe Illustrator

Developed and marketed by Adobe Inc., Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program. The development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985 for the Apple Macintosh. Adobe released Illustrator CC along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's move to a subscription service delivered over the Internet). The latest version of Illustrator, Illustrator 2022, was released on October 26, 2021, and represents the 25th generation of the product. PC Magazine ranked Adobe Illustrator as the best vector graphics editing program for 2018. With Adobe Illustrator, you can capture your creative vision with shapes, colors, effects, and typography. Create beautiful designs that can be used across desktop and mobile devices and on any platform - print, the web, apps, videos, animations, etc.

## AVIF

AVIF, a new image compression codec, offers a much smaller file size than JPEG, which has been used for over 20 years. This compression can be accomplished without sacrificing image quality or details in the image. Furthermore, it reduces the weight of an image by approximately half in comparison to a WebP.
