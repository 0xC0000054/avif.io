## What is AVIF

File compression is necessary to free up network infrastructure resources. AVIF aims to improve data traffic efficiency and replace the widely used JPEG format in the long term. Compared to JPEG, AVIF offers better quality and compression. There is interest in introducing a new image format among data that can be compressed both losslessly and lossy. In addition, AVIF supports extended color spaces (wide color gamut, WCG) and features such as graininess, chroma subsampling, and HDR (high dynamic range).

Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and some others support AVIF.

## Uploadcare supports AVIF

Uploadcare Image processing pipeline now supports AVIF images as a source. AVIF images can be uploaded when `imagesOnly` option is enabled.

By using AVIF, you are increasing your processing usage since AVIF is intensive to encode. Consequently, it takes longer for the processing to take place. The problem is noticeable with delays of a few seconds. With the API, eager processing can be used to transform data on upload.

### Example code

const imagesOnlyAcceptTypes = [ 'image/avif',
                                'image/avif-sequence',
                                '.avif',
                                '.avifs',
                               ].join(',')
