## What is Uppy?

Uppy is a sleek, configurable JavaScript file uploader that integrates seamlessly with any application. It is fast, has a user-friendly API, and allows you to focus on more important issues rather than developing a file upload component. Using the app, users can access files stored locally, remotely, via Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Instagram, or even take selfies with a camera. Files can be downloaded from external sources battery-friendly if desired, letting servers handle the heavy lifting. The metadata can then be edited and viewed and finally uploaded to the final destination, with optional processing/encoding.

With Uppy, you get a lightweight, modular, plugin-based architecture that is easy to maintain. By allowing resumable file uploads and file recovery, it is able to handle network and browser crashes or misclicks.

With an open-source implementation and built with accessibility in mind, Uppy is a truly modern tool.

## Uppy JXL support

Since the 29th of July 2020, Uppy supports handling of AVIF files. Even though the file upload has worked, it supports fully displaying image thumbnails as well.
