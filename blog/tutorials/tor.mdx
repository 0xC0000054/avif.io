## What is AVIF

An AV1 Image File Format specifies a way to store images or image sequences compressed with AV1 for use with HEIF. Competitors include HEIC, which uses the same ISOBMFF-based container format, but HEVC's compression. An official final version of AVIF 1.0.0 was released on February 28th. Several tests by Netflix in 2020 showed AVIF is more efficient than JPEG at compressing natural images, texts, and graphics. It also has fewer blocking artifacts and shows minor color bleeding around hard edges. This format is supported by key players in the digital economy, resulting in its continued expansion. AV1 and AVIF are open-source formats. You don't have to pay for using AOMedia technology. There are many benefits, not just for the big players but also for the entire community. AVIF is free, a significant advantage over HEIF, one of Apple's most preferred formats. This image format satisfies the requirements of a modern image format by combining high image quality with many functions. According to the current version of AVIF, pictures are reduced by around 50 percent compared to the existing JPEG format. The AVIF program is also more efficient than its competition, WebP, which has not been successful. The highly efficient AVIF compression significantly shortens the time to load websites, conserves network bandwidth, and reduces data streams for video-on-demand services, cloud storage, and webspace providers. The advantages of AVIF compression go beyond their benefits online. These include image archiving, photographers, and printers. Those who receive images in the format can receive higher resolution images that reduce resource usage.

## What is Tor

The Onion Router (Tor) enables anonymous communication using free, open-source software. To completely protect users' locations and usage from network surveillance and traffic analysis, it directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network. The network includes more than six thousand relays. The use of Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity back to the user. As a privacy and freedom-protecting tool, Tor is intended to provide users with the freedom to communicate confidentially on the Internet without being monitored.
