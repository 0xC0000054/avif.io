## What is AVIF

The AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) is a standard file format for storing images or image sequences compressed with AV1 and stored in the HEIF container format. It competes with HEIC, which uses the same container format based on ISOBMFF, but uses HEVC for compression. AVIF 1.0.0 was released in February 2019. Netflix conducted several tests on compressed images, text, and graphics in 2020, demonstrating that AVIF had better compression efficiency than JPEG, better detail preservation, fewer blocking artifacts, and less bleed-through on hard edges of composites of natural images and text.

## What is Notion

Notion is a software tool for managing projects and taking notes. It is a piece of software that helps members of a company or organization coordinate deadlines, objectives, and tasks to increase efficiency and productivity. The Notion platform offers collaboration features with kanban boards, tasks, wikis, databases, and modified Markdown support. This product provides a single workspace for note-taking, knowledge and data management, and task and project management. Users can comment on ongoing projects, participate in discussions, and receive feedback using this file management tool. In addition to cross-platform applications, it is also accessible via most web browsers.

## AVIF support

Notion functions perfectly with AVIF images. You can upload or drag and drop the image from your computer using the attachment widget.
