      Cloudflare mainly provides content distribution services and offers free hosting for many
      websites to quickly optimize the content loading on the user side. On the 3rd of October,
      Cloudflare has announced support for automatically serving AVIF images. Let's keep in mind
      that more than half of an average website is spent on pictures and around 15% of all websites
      are powered by Cloudflare services. This marks a massive step toward making the web a faster
      place. Services like Discord, ILovePDF, Okta, Medium and Udemy all rely on the technological
      foundation of Cloudflare. WE suppose you are visiting this site because you are owning a
      website with Cloudflare services and would like to know how to turn on AVIF support. Oh, and
      by the way, this post is not sponsored in any kind. Let's see:
      <BlogSubtitle text="Why Cloudflare supports avif" />
      Regarding their latest blog post about avif, Cloudflare has made the decision to support avif
      for the following advantages:
      <BlogAdvantages advantages={advantages} checked={true} />
      <BlogSubtitle text="Business & Pro Plan" />
      Converting images to the AVIF format is part of the Image Resizing feature. Sadly, this
      feature is not free and part of their Business Plan. As a Business plan is quite expensive at
      around $200 / month, this seems like overkill for such a feature. However, in a comment
      section on the Cloudflare Blog, Kornel Lesi≈Ñski from Cloudflare said that converting images
      automatically to serve the best variant for your users will be part of Cloudflare's 'Polish'
      feature in the future. It will therefore be accessible to Pro Users as well. Pro Plans start
      at $20 / month and come with many more features. Like automatically choosing the best TCP
      settings, automatic mobile and image optimizations, a better firewall, captchas, cache
      analytics and more. For an upcoming small to medium-sized business, this seems like an
      attractive investment to get the last bit of performance out of your website. (Psst
      Cloudflare, sponsor me, I like you!)
      <BlogSubtitle text="Implementation with Workers" />
      Browsers with AVIF support add an image/avif note to their Accept request header. To request
      the AVIF format from the Image Resizing module of Cloudflare, simply set the format option to
      avif. Using a worker script, you can auto-detect and enable support for AVIF easily:
      <BlogSyntax language="javascript">
        {`addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  const imageURL = "https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg";

  const resizingOptions = {
    width: 800,
    sharpen: 1.0,
  };

  const accept = event.request.headers.get("accept");
  const isAVIFSupported = /image\/avif/.test(accept);
  if (isAVIFSupported) {
    resizingOptions.format = "avif";
  }
  event.respondWith(fetch(imageURL), {cf:{image: resizingOptions}})
})`}
      </BlogSyntax>
      The resizing feature is accessed via the options of a fetch() subrequest inside a Worker. It
      might also be beneficial to dynamically serve more image features based on the network's
      condition. Crisp-clear images in 4K are still incredible if your visitors have a bandwidth
      that supports it, and you can keep serving the large file size.
      <BlogSubtitle text="The picture element" />
      In our Tutorial on how to use AVIF in HTML, we present you the {`<picture>`} element as the
      best option to serve AVIF files in an HTML environment. Cloudflare allows you to use their
      image optimization endpoint to perform the conversion if you don't want to use Workers.
      <BlogSyntax language="html">
        {`<picture>
    <source type="image/avif" 
            srcset="/cdn-cgi/image/format=avif/image.jpg">
    <img src="/image.jpg">
</picture>`}
      </BlogSyntax>
      That's it for today's article. If you'd love to find out more about Cloudflare and their avif
      support, feel free to check out the sources below. As said already, we are not sponsored in
      any way. However, we find it amazing when companies push technologies, which Cloudflare
      regularly does. They already have preliminary support for HTTP/3 as well. Is there anything
      else you'd like to know about avif? Got a good suggestion on an advanced worker script? Let us
      know on Justin's Twitter.
