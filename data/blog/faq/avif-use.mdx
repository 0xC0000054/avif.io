AVIF can be used in a variety of ways. The format replaces PNG, JPEG, and WebP in all images, including photos and graphics. Businesses should use AVIF because it is smaller than JPEGs and can compress several megabytes into only a few bytes without affecting quality. Furthermore, this reduces data usage and speeds up your website's loading, allowing for faster information access and higher conversions.
