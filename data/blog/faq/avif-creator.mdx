title: Who created AVIF?
answer: "Leading players in the digital economy met in 2015 to discuss file compression. In 2015, companies such as Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Microsoft, Google (including YouTube), Netflix, Intel, AMD, and more formed the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), focusing on internet data usage. In addition to maximizing the performance of individual websites, better file compression can also make the web run faster as smaller files require less data traffic, use less energy, and require less storage. Technology needs to be free of licensing fees and openly accessible to become a standard. With its headquarters in Wakefield, Massachusetts, the Alliance for Open Media is a non-profit association that develops said open, royalty-free technology for multimedia delivery."
