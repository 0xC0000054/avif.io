title: What are the downsides of AVIF?
answer: "Encoding and creating AVIF images takes longer. This could cause problems with sites that generate images dynamically. The AVIF team is improving the speed of encoding. Critics say that since the image format is derived from AV1, it is not optimized as a single image format, as opposed to JPEG XL. Images encoded with AVIF may also draw more CPU power to display than images encoded with other codecs. Depending on the size of the image, the difference may be compensated, though. Regarding support,70% of current browsers can view AVIF images, and not all programs currently support it (e.g. Adobe Photoshop)."
