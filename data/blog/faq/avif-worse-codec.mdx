AVIF has some disadvantages that are worse than other codecs. AVIF supports no progressive rendering. Also, compared to standard image formats, the encoding process takes much longer. Therefore, it may not work with applications that need a large number of files to be encoded quickly (e.g., games or scenes with many animated characters). The longer encoding times may negate the greater savings in file size.
