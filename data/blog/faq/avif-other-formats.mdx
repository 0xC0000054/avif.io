title: Is AVIF based on other formats?
answer: "AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) and the AV1 Video Codec have been developed due to the AOM consortium's efforts. This technology integrates Apple's long-established HEIF container technology with AV1 compression algorithms. With HEIF, image content encoded with AV1 can be exchanged, stored (e.g., metadata), and transmitted consistently and standardized. AVIF and HEIF are analogous in that sense. They use different compression methods to encode image data. HEIF uses the HEVC video format instead of AV1."
