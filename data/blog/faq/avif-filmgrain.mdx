title: Does AVIF support film grain?
answer: "Film grain is supported by auto-regressive noise synthesis in AVIF. Decoding is possible in AV1 due to the use of film grain in the coding domain. A correlation between the color components of grain must be considered when estimating film grain. A model based on the autoregressive (AR) algorithm is applied to AV1. While AVIF is more flexible when it comes to middle band noise, it is more complicated when it comes to block boundaries."
