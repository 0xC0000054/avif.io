title: Why AVIF?
answer: "Why do we need a new image format? Why do we need AVIF? JPEG is the standard format for delivering web images. Unfortunately, it supports 8-bit images and does not support alpha channels. Even though WebP offers better compression, it lacks the flexibility of a modern image format. HEIF achieved better compression too, but patent issues prevented it from being introduced to other types of software. There is a need to replace JPEG with a widely supported alternative that is more efficient at compression and has a broader feature set for seamless integration into all types of software and services. AVIF can offer such a solution."
