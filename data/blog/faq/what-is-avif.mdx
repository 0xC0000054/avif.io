The AV1 image format (short: AVIF) is a royalty-free and open-source picture format. A large number of companies including Google, Apple, and Amazon collaborate on this format since 2019. AVIF offers a considerable feature palette such as 12-bit color depth, HDR support, chroma subsampling, and film grain. It has significantly better compression than older formats such as JPG, PNG, or WebP. AVIF has already gained a lot of attention from companies such as Netflix and it has the potential to be widely adopted as an image format for web delivery.
