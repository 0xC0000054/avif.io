title: How good is AVIF encoding speed?
answer: "AVIF encodes slowly in general. AOM will continue to improve the codec and reference encoder to improve encoding speed. The AVIF format allows for separately encoding and decoding tiled images since they are sliced into smaller blocks. Encoding blocks in parallel is beneficial because it uses all the CPU cores available."
