title: Does AVIF support animation?
answer: "To provide animation, AVIF uses sequencing. This image format is based on a video codec and is excellent for encoding motion pictures. To avoid astronomical data sizes, AVIF uses interframe compression, where only the differences between frames are encoded. It is now possible to achieve the fidelity and resolution of videos in animated images while maintaining the ease of delivery."
