title: Is AVIF lossless?
answer: "The AVIF format supports lossless compression. When compared to some other lossless formats, the AVIF lossless mode isn't the best. In terms of byte size, WebP and even PNG outperformed lossless AVIF. When AVIF is compressed with lossy compression, there is a better byte size saving than when it is compressed with lossless compression."
