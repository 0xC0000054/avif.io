title: Does AVIF support layers
answer: "With AVIF, multiple spatial layers can be encoded in one frame. A spatial layer may increase the quality or resolution of the decoded image based on one or more previous layers. A layer may also provide the decoded image independently. Moreover, not every layer produces images intended for rendering. Sometimes, decoded images are used only as intermediate images."
