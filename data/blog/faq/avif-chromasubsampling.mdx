There are three types of chroma subsampling supported by AVIF: 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4. Encoding images uses less resolution for chroma information than for luma information due to a lower understanding of color differences than that of luminance differences. In cases where the loss caused by 420 subsampling is not apparent to the human eye, 420 subsampling can be beneficial.
