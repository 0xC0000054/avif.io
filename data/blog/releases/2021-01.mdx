## Performance

Although improving the speed of the file conversion is our primary priority next to shipping new features, we constantly aim to improve the overall loading time of the website. Since the image conversion takes place client-side, we aim to minimize the overall clutter caused by the conversion to preserve your computer's resources. In this release, we were able to clean up a lot of code and remove some dependencies.

- Reduced overall page size by 25%

## User Experience

Constantly measuring the User Experience is like a drug to us. We once again ensured that everything ran smoothly after the big December release, or even better than before. Thanks to Hotjar and your feedback, we will make even more changes in this direction in the future.

- If you accept the Cookie Banner, it won't show again
