## Detailed alphabetical list

The <Link className="inline" text="Android Browser" href="/blog/tutorials/androidbrowser/" /> supports AVIF. Based on the open-source Blink layout engine,
Android's browser includes the Chromium V8 JavaScript engine. With the WebKit-based
Android Browser, the Acid3 test on Android 4.0 ICS scored 100/100, while Blink has
better support for standards. Formerly known as the "Android browser", the "AOSP
browser", the "stock browser", and "default browser" , the old web browser is known
by many names. Google began licensing Google Chrome with Android 4.4 KitKat separately
from Android , but typically packaged with (what most device vendors did). Google
has separated the WebView browser, which apps can use to display web content without
leaving the app, from the rest of Android 5.0 Lollipop, to facilitate separate security
updates.

<Link
  text="Baidu's discontinued WebKit and Trident browser"
  href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_Browser"
/> was developed for personal computers and mobile phones. It also leaks search terms,
hard drive serial number, network MAC address, and the title of every page visited
when using the Windows version of Baidu Browser. In addition, the model number of
the GPU is transmitted. You could block advertisements, download torrents, and watch
videos with it. In April 2019, it was deprecated, so AVIF is not supported.

The <Link text="Brave browser" href="/blog/tutorials/brave/" /> is a free and open-source browser which supports AVIF. It is derived from the Chromium web browser. It automatically blocks online ads and website trackers in its default settings, so it is a privacy-focused browser. Users can also opt-in to receive Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) in exchange for their attention by choosing optional ads. Additionally, users can earn and keep cryptocurrency and send tips to websites and content creators that support BAT.

Browsers developed by Google, such as <Link text="Google Chrome" href="/blog/tutorials/chrome/" />, are cross-platform and available for all major platforms, supporting AVIF. The first version of this program was released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, using open-source components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox. Several browser versions have been ported to Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. The browser is also the primary component of Chrome OS, which serves as the platform for web applications. The source code for Chrome comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware. Initially, Google used WebKit as its rendering engine but forked it to create the Blink engine. All Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.

Chrome's desktop version is well-known to most users. Additionally, Google has created a mobile version of the popular browser for Android-based mobile devices. Practically, <Link text="Chrome for Android" href="/blog/tutorials/chrome/" /> offers a particular download feature that allows you to quickly download videos, photos, and entire websites with a single click, including AVIF images. Once you register in Chrome, your reading history, passwords, and settings will be automatically synchronized across all your devices. You can now access all your information directly from a mobile device, laptop, or tablet computer. Another exciting feature of Chrome for Android is a data reduction mode. Using the mentioned method, traffic is not only saved on pictures and text, but it is also possible to handle videos for a while. The Google proposal will allow you to save up to 60 percent in data volume, thus avoiding the ossification caused by mobile providers.

Windows <Link text="Edge" href="/blog/tutorials/edge/" /> is a cross-platform browser loped by Microsoft. Edge is not supporting AVIF. Edge was initially released in 2015 for Windows 10 and Xbox One, for Android and iOS in 2017, for macOS in 2019, and Linux in 2020, and is capable of replacing Internet Explorer with Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later versions, although, unlike Internet Explorer, it does not support Windows Vista or earlier versions. Chrome-based Edge replaced Internet Explorer with Windows 11 as the default web browser (compatible with Google Chrome). The Edge browser lags slightly behind Safari as the third most popular (desktop) web browser and is ahead or tied with Safari during weekdays (Safari is the most popular desktop browser across platforms, while Edge is still third).

Mozilla <Link text="Firefox" href="/blog/tutorials/firefox/" /> and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, develop a free and open-source web browser, Firefox. Firefox supports AVIF. The Gecko rendering engine, which implements current and upcoming web standards, is used to display web pages. Quantum is a new technology that Firefox implemented in 2017 to promote parallelism and an intuitive interface. Microsoft Windows 7 and later versions, macOS, and Linux, are supported by Firefox. Unofficial ports are available for several Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix. An iOS and Android version are also available. Despite this, the iOS web browser uses WebKit instead of Gecko due to platform requirements. There is also an optimized version of the Silk Browser for Amazon Fire TV.

The mobile version of <Link text="Firefox for Android" href="/blog/tutorials/firefox/" /> OS has arrived and supports AVIF. With Firefox for Android, you can sync all the settings of your Desktop-Browser, including bookmarks, tabs, shortcuts, passwords, and extensions, to your Mobile Version via Sync. Firefox for Android supports Firefox Sync. You can copy your desktop browser's settings, including bookmarks, tabs, shortcuts, passwords, forms, and extensions, into the mobile version. You can also add reading indicators to your Android start screen. By clicking directly on the start screen, the websites can be accessed. Furthermore, Mozilla-Browser allows for private browsing within individual tabs.

With the official introduction of Microsoft Edge on January 21, 2015, the <Link text="Internet Explorer" href="/blog/tutorials/internetexplorer/" /> browser is no longer Windows 10's default browser. Since it is discontinued, it does not support new formats like AVIF. The installation of Internet Explorer in Windows 10 allows compatibility with older websites and intranet sites requiring ActiveX and other Microsoft legacy web technologies. Microsoft says no new features will be added to Internet Explorer with Windows 11. It will continue to be maintained, if necessary, as part of the support policy for Windows versions with which it is included. On June 1, 2020, the Internet Archive removed the latest version of Internet Explorer from its list of supported browsers, citing its dated infrastructure as making it difficult to work with. According to a suggestion from Microsoft Chief Security Officer Chris Jackson, users shouldn't use Internet Explorer 11 as their default browser but only to access websites that demand it. Since November 30, 2020, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 applications cannot be accessed with Internet Explorer 11 or earlier, followed by the remainder of Microsoft 365 applications since August 17, 2021. Internet Explorer users are recommended to migrate to Edge and use the built-in "Internet Explorer mode" to enable support for legacy internet apps during the lifecycle of the Windows version on which it is installed until June 15, 2022.

<Link text="Opera" href="/blog/tutorials/opera/" /> was developed by the name-brand
company Opera. Opera and Opera mobile support AVIF, since Chromium is the engine
behind Opera. Opera is one of the oldest desktop web browsers still actively developed
today, first released on 10 April 1995. Users will be able to distinguish it by its
unique user interface. In its first ten years, Presto was commercial software, and
it had its proprietary layout engine. Opera's operating systems include Microsoft
Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and Linux. Opera switched from the Presto engine to
Chromium in 2013. Additionally, <Link
  text="Opera Mobile"
  href="/blog/tutorials/opera/"
/> and <Link text="Opera Mini" href="/blog/tutorials/opera/" /> (not supporting AVIF)
are available for mobile devices. Moreover, Opera users access Opera News, a news
app based on AI. The company released a gaming-focused version of Opera, Opera GX,
in 2019 and a blockchain-focused Opera Crypto Browser into public beta in January
2022.

"Your browser, Your way" is the motto of <Link href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Moon" text="Pale Moon"/>, an open-source web browser emphasized for its customizability. It doesn't support AVIF. There are official releases for Windows and Linux and contributed builds for other platforms. Pale Moon originally forked from Firefox but diverged later. Differences include user interfaces, add-on support, and single-process operation. The Pale Moon interface retains the highly customizable features of Firefox 4–28. Also, it continues to support some add-ons and plugins that Firefox no longer supports, such as plugins such as NPAPI. In version 29.2.0, Pale Moon stopped supporting Firefox extensions, but the restriction will be removed eventually.

Tencent is a Chinese technology company not supporting AVIF, that developed the <Link text="QQ Browser" href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QQ_browser"/>. The browser uses two different engines: Trident and WebKit. As part of its effort to integrate the QQ browser of the WebKit engine 5, Tencent had developed Tencent Explorer (Tencent TE) and Tencent TT based on the Trident typesetting engine and the Tencent TT browser.

Apple developed <Link text="Safari" href="/blog/tutorials/safari/" />, a graphical web browser. It does not support AVIF. Open-source software, mainly WebKit, is used to make it. It was the default web browser for Macintosh computers after Netscape Navigator, Cyberdog, and Internet Explorer. From 2007 to 2010, a Windows version was offered; Safari was introduced with Mac OS X Panther and, as of 2021, has progressed through fifteen significant versions. The Macintosh edition was ranked first with the fastest browser performance. The third generation (January 2007) brought iPhone compatibility via iPhone OS 1. In June 2010, a less distracted page reader, extension, and developer tools were added; the final Windows version was also added. As of the eleventh release (September 2017), Intelligent Tracking Prevention was added. The thirteenth version of the application included a range of new privacy and application features, including the support for FIDO2 USB security keys and Apple Pay web support. It was 50% faster than Google Chrome. It used less battery power than other standard competitors in the fourteenth version, released in November 2020. There is a new interface in the fifteenth revision (July 2021).

Samsung Electronics'<Link text="Samsung Internet" href="/blog/tutorials/samsunginternet/" /> Browser (or simply S Browser) is an internet browser for smartphones and tablets, supporting the AVIF image format. Chromium is powering this browser, and Galaxy phones come with them pre-installed. Since 2015, it has been available through Google Play; recently, it was also made available through Samsung's Galaxy Store for their Tizen-based smartwatch. According to Samsung, around 400 million users used it every month in 2016. StatCounter estimates about 4.98% market share in May 2018 (among 53.26% of all Chrome variants). Its differences from Chromium are caused mainly by its support for Samsung-specific hardware, including Gear VR and biometric sensors.

<Link

  href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)"
/> supports AVIF enables anonymous communication using free, open-source software.
To completely protect users' locations and usage from network surveillance and traffic
analysis. The network includes more than six thousand relays. The use of Tor makes
it more difficult to trace Internet activity back to the user. As a privacy and freedom-protecting
tool, Tor is intended to provide users with the freedom to communicate confidentially
on the Internet without being monitored.

<Link text="UC Browser" href="/blog/tutorials/ucbrowser/" /> is a web browser not
supporting AVIF, developed by the Alibaba Group's mobile internet subsidiary, UCWeb.
China ranked second in terms of mobile browser popularity, while India and Indonesia
ranked first. According to StatCounter, its browser share in May 2022 was 0.86% globally
(and 1.48% on smartphones). Initially developed in Java, it is now available on several
platforms, including Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, Java ME, Symbian, Windows Phone,
and Microsoft Windows. After several privacy and security controversies, China banned
it from India on June 29, 2020, just before the China-India skirmishes began in 2020–2022.

<Link text="Vivaldi" href="/blog/tutorials/vivaldi/" /> is a cross-platform, freeware
web browser supporting AVIF, developed by Vivaldi Technologies. The company was founded
by Tatsuki Tomita and Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, the co-founder and CEO of Opera
Software. It was officially launched on April 6, 2016, but is predominantly aimed
at technically-inclined users and former Opera users disgruntled by its transition
from the Presto layout engine to Chromium, eliminating many of Opera's iconic features.
While it is also based on Chrome, Vivaldi aims to bring back the qualities of Opera's
Presto-based engine. Vivaldi released beta versions for iOS (September 2019) and
Android (April 2020). It had about 2.3 million active users by September 2021.
