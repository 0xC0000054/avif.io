## Introduction

Due to its superior compression properties, the AV1 image file format makes a great image file format. Image files with smaller sizes are of excellent quality. However, few software applications and hardware options support them. Because of this, it is not surprising that people are seeking tools to convert AVIF to PNG. You can convert AVIF files to the more popular PNG format using many tools available.

## Online Converter

### squoosh.app

<Link href="squoosh.app/" text="Link" />

The Squoosh app allows you to compress images in various formats and reduce their size. You can reduce file size without sacrificing quality. Open your image and check where the differences are, then save it right away.

You do not need to upload images to Squoosh's servers, and the compression happens in your web browser. Squoosh is a browser-based product that compresses images for you. It supports several image formats and processes them client-side in the browser using WebAssembly. Hence, instead of sending your pictures to a remote server, you can keep them on your computer. Additionally, Squoosh can be accessed offline.

Using Google's Squoosh application is an excellent way to play around. This program converts AVIF files to PNG images. You can compare the output image size to other file formats as you experiment with compression settings. PNG quality settings include support for progressive PNG, which can be customized to your needs.

### ezgif.com

<Link href="ezgif.com" text="Link" />

Create and edit images online by using the Ezgif.com website. The tool also provides image editing functions and conversions. Support is provided for the WebP Format, PNG images, etc., and AVIF support was recently added. As a bonus, EzGif can support image sequences as well.

Using the PNG conversion tool, you can select the compression level and the background color of images with transparency. After uploading your image in AVIF format, Ezgif will present you with a comprehensive list of options.

### cloudconvert.com

<Link href="cloudconvert.com" text="Link" />

This online tool lets you convert any type of file, such as the PNG XR format, HEIF format, or PNG format. You do not need any special software to use the tool, and the files are encrypted to prevent others from accessing them. They use both open-source software and software from several vendors.

Cloudconvert offers a wide range of conversion types that can be tailored to meet your needs, including choosing the quality of the conversion and other options. Upload a file, and you'll be able to change its dimensions, choose quality, and remove metadata.

Unfortunately, its PNG converter is slightly limited in the free version. Once you have created an account, you can bypass their first entry barrier. A maximum of two conversions can, however, be made at a time.

### convertio.io

<Link href="convertio.io" text="Link" />

Convertio had the slowest performance and the fewest features compared to all the converters tested. As a result, your output image cannot be controlled, and the conversion process takes several seconds per file.

The free and paid versions both include Dropbox and Google Drive compatibility. There is a cloud-based conversion process. Files are deleted immediately after upload and 24 hours after conversion.

## Software converter

### Filestar

<Link href="filestar.com" text="Link" />

A program called Filestar is used for converting files and editing images. Several clicks can convert one or more files, merge, split, transform, compress, or extract. The desktop app provides more than 30000 skills for any file extension.

It is efficient and fast. This free tool automates the conversion process by taking input images step-by-step. It is best suited for batch conversions, primarily since it works on the step-by-step principle.

## CLI Converter

### ImageMagick

<Link href="imagemagick.org" text="Link" />

An image editor, composer, and converter, ImageMagick is a freeware program. More than 200 image formats are supported. Images can be resized, flipped, mirrored, rotated, distorted, sheared, and transformed with ImageMagick. It can also be adjusted for colors, various special effects and drawn with text, lines, polygons, ellipses, and BÃ©zier curves.

With version 7.0.25, AVIF image conversion and compression are now natively supported. By specifying the "-define" command-line option, you can set additional parameters for the PNG output file.

<Syntax language="xml">{`magick input.avif output.png`}</Syntax>

### Sharp

<Link href="sharp.pixelplumbing.com/" text="Link" />

High-performance Node.js module for converting large images to more minor, web-friendly PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF images. Using libvips improves resizing speed 4x-5x over ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings. All color spaces, embedded ICC profiles, and alpha transparency channels are correctly handled. With Lanczos, speed isn't sacrificed for quality.

Aside from resizing images, other features include rotation, extraction, compositing, and gamma correction. Modern systems that run Node.js under Mac, Windows, and Linux don't require additional installs or runtime dependencies. See sharp.pixelplumbing.com for more information.

<Syntax language="xml">
  {`sharp("bear.avif")
.png()
.resize({ width: size })
.toFile("bear.png") }`}
</Syntax>

### Squoosh CLI

<Link href="github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli" text="Link" />

The CLI will be discussed this time; we had already addressed Squoosh. Squoosh v2 was announced at Chrome DevSummit 2020, and a command-line interface for all of Squoosh's codecs using Node.js and WebAssembly.

You can use the CLI to let Squoosh choose the codec parameters for you and compress entire folders with just one command. npx allows Squoosh CLI to be used directly from the command line without requiring installation. The Squoosh CLI can also be installed if desired. Their official Github has more information.

To parallelize image processing, Squoosh CLI uses worker pools. The codec used by Squoosh can encrypt multiple photos simultaneously. No, Squoosh CLI does not claim to be the fastest image compression tool on the market. Yet it compresses a large number of images at once.

<Syntax language="xml">{`squoosh-cli --png  input.avif`}</Syntax>

A Squoosh CLI auto-optimizer also attempts to compress an image to the maximum using Butteraugli targets. The output can introduce more artifacts as the Butteraugli target value increases. By specifying "auto" as the configuration object, you will be able to use the auto optimizer.

<Syntax language="xml">{`npx @squoosh/cli --wp2 auto test.png`}</Syntax>

The web interface and CLI command can both be tested out.

/>

Since the CLI allows for a great deal of automation, it's natural that developers have requested a more conversational interface than programmatically calling the Squoosh CLI via the shell. Ultimately, the goal is to make image compression more accessible to tooling authors.

The inclusion of Webpack, Rollup, and other build tools is a welcome addition to ensure that your images are appropriately optimized for the web. Visit https://web.dev/introducing-libsquoosh for more information.

### Cloudconvert

<Link href="www.npmjs.com/package/cloudconvert-cli" text="Link" />

You can customize the API of Cloudconvert to integrate with your application. You can integrate Amazon S3 fully with Cloudconvert. Command-line tools are also available. This CloudConvert API v2 CLI enables users to convert files from the terminal quickly and easily. In the command line, cloudconvert-node is used, which requires Node.js.

## Graphics Editing

You can open AVIF images with Microsoft Paint after installing the AV1 Plugin. However, you may prefer to use an alternative tool. Several graphics editors let you open and save AVIF files in another format. In some cases, they may not be your first choice for converting avif to png, but they can be helpful if you wish to edit the images.

### GIMP

<Link href="gimp.org" text="Link" />

It can manipulate and edit images, perform free-form drawing, convert images between different file types, and perform more specialized tasks. With this freeware, you can retouch photos, compose images, and create images. There are many similarities between GIMP and Photoshop. It is an excellent choice if you need a free image editor.

### Krita

<Link href="krita.org/en/" text="Link" />

Create and manipulate images with Krita. Paint, illustrate, create concept art, and work on other creative tasks with Krita. A canvas can be OpenGL-based or unaccelerated in Krita.

### IrfanView

<Link href="irfanview.com" text="Link" />

The IrfanView program includes image editors, organizers, and converters, among its features. The program can also play video and audio files and create and paint images. There is a fee for commercial use, and using IrfanView for non-commercial purposes is free. IrfanView, for example, may not be as pleasing to the eye as Windows' photo viewer. However, they offer greater power, flexibility, and performance than the default tools provided by the operating system.

### Paint.net

<Link href="getpaint.net" text="Link" />

Painting.NET is a Windows-based image editing program. With a user-friendly interface, layers are supported, special effects can be applied, and valuable and powerful tools can be used. Plugins and support are available online from a community of enthusiasts.

### XnView MP

<Link href="www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/" text="Link" />

The Multi-Platform project of XnView is XnViewMP, and Linux and Macintosh users can use the same XnView application. It is fully Unicode compatible, and it utilizes multiple CPU cores.

## What is AVIF anyways?

The Alliance for Open Media developed the new image format AVIF using keyframes of video format AV1. As Netflix has acknowledged, the AVIF image format has better file size compression than PNG, JPEG, and WebP. Despite PNG's existence for decades, it is time for a new, more advanced alternative. This makes AVIF a fascinating development with a wide range of applications, and AVIF can be used in different ways.

Consequently, images in PNG, JPEG, and WebP are replaced. Due to AVIF's smaller size than PNG, businesses should use them since they can compress several megabytes into a few bytes without sacrificing any quality. Additionally, this reduces data consumption and speeds up your website's loading speed, making information more accessible and allowing for more conversions.

AVIF support is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Android Browser, and Samsung Internet. In addition to AVIF, Microsoft Edge and Safari are yet to follow. With JPEG XL, you can choose between lossless compression and lossy compression. This format is intended to replace existing raster formats by outperforming them.
