## Bugticket solved

Mozilla maintained a bugticket for two years asking for AV1 hardware decoding support when possible. The reason for this is that Intel has embedded AV1 hardware decoding in their latest mobile processors and microprocessors.

This bug has been present for around two years now. There has been considerable interest in it over the last few weeks and now, hardware decoding support for the Windows Media Foundation AV1 decoder has been added.

If you want to take advantage of the latest enhancements and features, you may need to update your graphics driver.

## Requirements

**You need the following to experience full support:**

1. (1) One of these GPUs or CPUs:

- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs or
- 11th Gen Intel Core processors or
- AMD Radeonâ„¢ RX 6000 Series GPUs

2. (2) Windows 10 build 1909 or later
3. (3) The AV1 Video Extension
4. (4) The latest version of Firefox

During the next few years, streaming services will provide more video content encoded with AV1 and you will benefit from hardware-accelerated AV1 video.
