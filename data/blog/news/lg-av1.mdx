## What is AV1?

LG will cooperate with its peers, including Amazon, Apple, Samsung, ARM, Nvidia, Netflix, and Microsoft, to accelerate AV1 adoption.

Open-source codecs such as AV1 enable more screens to display vivid images, deeper colors, brighter highlights, deeper shadows, and other enhancements to UHD imaging that consumers and businesses expect - while using fewer data to do so.

AV1 is an interoperable, open, internet-optimized, and scalable video format for any device at any bandwidth. To begin designing AV1 into products, toolmakers and developers can download the AV1 specification, reference code, and bindings to tailor AV1 for hardware optimization.

## What is the Alliance for Open Media?

As a result of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) 's foundation in 2015, the Alliance will define and develop media technologies to address the marketplace demand for an open standard for video transmission over the Internet. Among the Founding Members at the Board level are Amazon, Apple, Arm, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, NVIDIA, Samsung Electronics, and Tencent. The open-source, royalty-free AV1 video codec developed by AOMedia marks a significant step forward in developing an interoperable, open, and scalable video format that will be suitable for any modern device at any bandwidth.

## Next steps

AV1 is being introduced increasingly slowly: it was first announced in 2018. Accordingly, the rollout has been more limited than expected. Despite both Netflix and YouTube experimenting with AV1, no streaming service has yet committed to integrating the format on a large scale.

This is due to the chicken & egg problem that has arisen. So, the hardware support for AV1 is also not as far along as one might have expected after nearly four years. However, Google has made it mandatory for new Android TV devices to provide AV1 support. For LG, this is not a new development since they have supported AV1 on their televisions since 2020. However, LG uses the webOS platform as the TV operating system.

LG supports AV1 in their OLED televisions as well as the CX models.
