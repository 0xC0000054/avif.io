Qualcomm is reportedly working on supporting the video codec AV1 for its upcoming high-end mobile chips. They will integrate support into the next generation of smartphones in the coming year.

AVIF is the focus of this website, but it is essential to know that AV1 support will make AVIF more adaptable. This image file format specification is based on the AV1 compression standard.

## What is AV1?

The AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) codec is a next-generation codec for video streaming. It will replace the HEVC (H.265) format currently used by platforms such as Netflix for 4K HDR videos.

Alliance for Open Media led the effort, with members such as Amazon, Apple, ARM, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Nvidia, and Samsung.

With it, internet streaming will be more efficient without compromising on quality. It represents an important step towards the adoption of streaming 8K video, given the more data-intensive requirements of this higher-resolution format.

The royalty-free nature of AV1 also makes it attractive to streaming giants. As a result, video platforms and device manufacturers no longer have to pay licensing fees associated with codecs such as HEVC.

The AV1 video codec shows anywhere up to 30% more efficient compression than HEVC. However, AV1 encoding takes along time. AV1 is expected to make significant improvements in this area. It is a problem that AOM must resolve before widespread adoption is possible.

## Current adaptation

Major video providers have delayed using the open-video codec AV1 while waiting for broader device support. Netflix announced in October 2016 that it would be an early adopter of AV1. YouTube rolled out AV1 in 2018.

Facebook announced in February 2019 that AV1 would be gradually rolled out. Vimeo began offering AV1 in June 2019, and iQIYI announced support for AV1 in April 2020. Twitch plans to roll out AV1 for its most popular content by 2022 or 2023.

Samsung announced the new Exynos 2200 chipset integrates power-efficient AV1 decoders that enable longer playback times. Both MediaTek and Broadcom have introduced chipsets that support AV1 decoding.

Google has been the leading promoter of AV1 so far. Chromecast is about to receive an update that will include a Google TV streaming adapter capable of playing AV1 streams.

Last year, Google made AV1 compatibility a requirement for its Android TV platform, used by many TV and streaming devices. Google's push to expand AV1 support is two-pronged. YouTube also requires device makers to implement AV1 to gain access to 4K streams.

## Better adaptation

Things may change in the coming months as consumer electronics companies and chipset manufacturers prepare to introduce hardware with native AV1 decoding capabilities.

Qualcomm is one of these companies, which intends to add AV1 support to its upcoming flagship Snapdragon mobile processor. Known internally as SM8550, the chip is expected to debut at the end of this year at the earliest. Hence, phones powered by it are unlikely to arrive until 2023.

Qualcomm's new Adreno video-processing unit will support native AV1 decoding, something that none of Qualcomm's previous products have offered.

We anticipate no significant changes to the design. Still, our source cautions that things could change before the chip is produced. In the past, the company had been unable to add AV1 support to its existing chips due to its long planning cycles.

## Adaptation is overdue

As long as hardware support is not widespread, streaming services are unlikely to re-encode their entire catalog, which can be a costly undertaking that potential bandwidth savings cannot offset. Additionally, without content to watch in AV1, hardware manufacturers have given up on adding codec support to their devices.

As of now, the adoption of AV1 has been hindered by a chicken-and-egg problem. It is long overdue that AV1 gains traction. Industry insiders have been frustrated with AV1's slow progress for some time now.

Disney, which has ties to the AOM via Hulu, is still exploratory. Likewise, HBO Max is not utilizing it, and AV1 has not been used by Snap yet.

There is a possibility that AV1 will finally be widely adopted by 2023. The provision of better hardware support increases the speed of encoding and decoding, which also benefits the AVIF use case. It is encouraging to learn that 2023 could be the year we see broader adaptation.
