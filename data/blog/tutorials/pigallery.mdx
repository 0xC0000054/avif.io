## What is PiGallery?

PiGallery is a fast catalog-based photo gallery website with a rich user interface optimized for low-resource servers. As well as supporting images in JPG, JPE, WebP, PNG, GIF, and SVG, it supports videos in MP4, OGG, OGV, and WebM.

Photos are displayed in a lazily-loaded grid format showing keywords and locations.

For a quicker loading experience, PiGallery automatically generates thumbnails and downscales photos on the fly. Additionally, it caches client-side and supports instant searching.

Additionally, PiGallery offers a custom lightbox for viewing full-screen photos and videos. You may also display pictures with GPS coordinates on an open street map, and you may enable face recognition.

## Does PiGallery support AVIF?

PiGallery does not support AVIF at this time. The author submitted a feature request on Github but refused to add support until Safari and Microsoft Edge supported it.
