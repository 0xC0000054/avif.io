## What is Emulsion

Emulsion is a lightweight, fast, and minimalistic image viewer primarily developed by Artúr Kovács. Despite its current testing on Linux and Windows, Emulation is targeted for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Wayland support is limited, but X is fully supported. Images appear instantly in Emulsion. At a certain scale threshold, it switches from a smooth display to real pixels. Besides typical zooming features, it offers a dark and light interface for better usability.

## AVIF support

There was a newly created Github issue in August 2020 asking for AVIF support. It was immediately incorporated into the automated build process.
