## What is AVIF

A group of companies, including Google, Mozilla, Cisco, and others, formed the AOMedia foundation, which has developed the AVIF image format. The video format is based on AV1, which was initially created to store keyframes. It was designed to replace outdated image formats, such as JPEG and WebP, with more modern features, such as HDR and 12-bit color. While maintaining the same level of perceived quality, AVIF outperforms JPG by 40-60% and WebP by 10-30%.

## What is imgix

The imgix service converts your existing static images into dynamic and responsive images that can be delivered to devices of any type and under any condition. We help sites and apps load faster and look better while freeing up engineering resources. You can make edits, croppings, and adjustments on the fly without affecting the original image. Using imgix, you can work with large sets of images in various sizes and formats for delivery over the Internet and to mobile devices. It is possible to bypass all batch image editing workflows entirely and manage your catalog using just a few lines of code.

## imgix AVIF support

To this date, imgix only support conversion to WebP regarding next-gen formats. It is uncertain whether they will add AVIF support in future.
