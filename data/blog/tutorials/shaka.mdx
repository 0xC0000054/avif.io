## AVIF Support

Shaka Player supports WebP and AVIF image streams as of the 12th of February 2022 (v3.4.0 release).

AVIF streams were dropped prior to this release. Earlier this year on Github, a request to support AVIF was submitted, which was successfully implemented within a few weeks.

It is exciting to see Shaka Player supporting AVIF, since this will benefit thumbnails and image tracks.

## What is Shaka Player?

Shaka Player is a JavaScript library for streaming adaptive video. It facilitates the adoption of technology that is relevant to Google by making them easy to use.

It supports adaptive media formats (such as DASH and HLS) in a browser, without the need for plugins or Flash. As opposed to this, Shaka Player uses open web standards, including MediaSource Extensions and Encrypted Media Extensions.

In addition, Shaka Player supports offline storage and playback of media using IndexedDB. Any browser can be used to save content. Browser compatibility determines the storage location of licenses.

The main objective is to make streaming of adaptive bitrate video and audio as simple as possible using modern browser technologies. The library is designed to be light, simple, and free from third-party dependencies.
