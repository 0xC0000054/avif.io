## What is Waterfox

As one of the first widely distributed 64-Bit browsers on the web, Waterfox gained a loyal following quickly. At one time, Waterfox was concerned with speed, but it aims to be an ethical, user-friendly browser as well.

The browser is designed to strike a balance between privacy and usability. If too much emphasis is placed on privacy, the web becomes too unusable. If not enough, data leakage occurs. Waterfox ensures that what you do inside your browser is known to you.

Waterfox runs on Gecko. Although most web browsers are powered by Blink or WebKit, these companies have chosen to use the technology that best matches their goals.

## AVIF support

Waterfox supports AVIF with the release of version 4.0.5.
