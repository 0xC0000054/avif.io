## What is AVIF

The AVIF file format was developed by the Alliance for Open Media as a way to reduce the size of our images without compromising the quality. It is considered a significant advancement in media compression by experts. The goal of AOMedia is to develop open, royalty-free technologies for delivering multimedia content. No one will be charged for the use of the new AVIF format. AOMedia is backed by some of the world's largest companies such as Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Currently, JPG and PNG are the most widely used formats for images on the Internet. Several years ago, Google introduced WebP, which is 30% smaller than JPG while retaining similar image quality. Pictures created with AVIF can be 50 percent smaller than JPG images while still maintaining the same degree of quality.

## What is Whatsapp

WhatsApp Messenger, orWhatsApp, is an American instant messaging (IM) and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc. It is a freeware, cross-platform service available on several platforms. The application enables users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share pictures, documents, user location information, and other content. As long as the user's mobile device is connected to the Internet while using the desktop app, WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices and can be accessed from desktop computers. To sign up for this service, a mobile phone number is required. In January 2018, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Business, a standalone business app designed for small businesses to communicate with customers who use the default WhatsApp client.

## AVIF support

To date, WhatsApp does not support the viewing of AVIF images inline, as other image formats do. However, they offer the option of sending your chat partner an AVIF image, which can be downloaded and viewed natively, like with other files.
