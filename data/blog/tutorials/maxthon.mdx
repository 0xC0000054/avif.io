## What is AVIF

In HEIF containers, AV1 Image File Format specifies the format for storing images and image sequences compressed with AV1. Comparable to HEIC, HEIC uses ISOBMFF for the container format but HEVC for compression. Version 1.0.0 of the AVIF specification was released in February. The Netflix 2020 test showed that AVIF has a higher compression efficiency than JPEG, retains more detail, has fewer blocking artifacts, and has little color bleeding around hard edges in composites of natural images, text, and graphics. AVIF is a format supported by big players in the digital economy that are driving its expansion. This is because both formats are open source. There are no additional charges associated with AOMedia technology. All open source developers benefit from this, not just the big players. The AVIF format is free of charge is a significant advantage over HEIF, which is still the preferred format for Apple. With AVIF, you can combine high image quality and many functions in one format. A current study shows that AVIF reduces an image's size by 50% compared to JPEG. In addition, AVIF is more efficient than WebP, which has not established itself. The highly efficient AVIF compression reduces website load times, conserves network bandwidth, and reduces data streams for video-on-demand providers, cloud hosts, and webspace providers. AVIF offers several benefits that extend beyond its online use. Photo archives, photographers, printers, etc. Those who use the format can also receive higher-quality images, which will ease the burden on limited resources.
