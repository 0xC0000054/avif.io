There is no official support. Still, WordPress needs AVIF because of two reasons. First, technical professionals and end-users often struggle with web speed issues widespread with this CMS. Hence, AVIF can contribute to faster loading because of its incredibly low file size without causing any dent in quality. The second reason is that WordPress is the most dominant CMS globally, with over 455 million websites in 2020. This means that around 35% of the web is powered by WordPress. Further statistics from WordPress reveal that as of November 2020, over 409 million people view more than 20 billion pages each month.',Object(s.jsx)(r.a,{url:"wordpress-usage",alt:"shows usage statistics of wordpress"}),Object(s.jsx)("h2",{children:"Official Wordpress Support"}),"The WordPress core has implemented a security check for file uploading since version 4.7. This means that WordPress checks your uploaded files' file extension (say that 10x as fast as possible) and rejects files that don't match their pattern. Most of you will know this due to the restriction to upload SVGs. The same story goes for modern image formats. To this day, WordPress still doesn't natively support viewing or uploading WebP images, AVIF images, or other modern formats. We could argue that AVIF is a new extension. However, considering that WebP is more than 10 years old, this really brings up the question if WordPress is ever going to add support to modern image formats.
