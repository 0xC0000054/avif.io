This is a shame, right? It took ten years for webP (another excellent image format, but not good enough to match avif) to become fully supported due to Apple's unwillingness to implement the format in Safari. But still, there's only 90% support. By the time of writing, AVIF has 25% support on browsers. Google Chrome and Opera support it. Firefox supports it if you enable the AVIF image format in the settings. Safari has no AVIF support yet. However, AVIF is an invention by the non-profit industry consortium Alliance of Open Media (AOM).
